## 0:00 - 2:00 | Introduction: The Core Problem

**[ACTION]** Start at the absolute top of the page. Do not scroll yet. Let the ambient background glowing orbs and the hero image set the mood. Keep your mouse still initially.

**Presenter:**
"Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone. Today, I want to ask you a fundamental question about how we measure intelligence and capability on a global scale."

**[ACTION]** Slowly move your mouse across the title "Lost in Translation" to demonstrate the gradient text effect.

**Presenter:**
"Standardized testing, like the PISA exam, is designed to measure student capability. But what happens when the test itself speaks a foreign language? 

Welcome to our project, *Lost in Translation*. Today we will explore the impact of the language of instruction on PISA outcomes, specifically comparing the Philippines with top-performing nations. Imagine trying to solve a complex math problem while simultaneously translating the question in your head. This 'cognitive gap' is exactly what non-native English speakers face. Let's explore how language policies shape educational destinies."

**[ACTION]** Hover your mouse over the 'Explore the Analysis' button to trigger the glow, scale, and arrow animation. Then slowly click it, or manually scroll down to the framework section.

## 2:00 - 3:30 | The Analytical Framework

**[ACTION]** Ensure the "Analytical Framework" glass card is centered on screen. Slowly move your mouse in a circle *inside* the card to show off the mouse-tracking spotlight glow effect.

**Presenter:**
"To ensure our comparative analysis is both structured and comprehensive, we utilize the Bray & Thomas framework from 1995. 

We aren't just looking at test scores in a vacuum. By integrating cross-national comparison and comparative policy analysis, we are examining how entire national education systems operate. We will break this down into four key areas: the Context they exist in, the Inputs they receive, the Processes they use, and finally, the Outcomes they produce."

---

## 3:30 - 6:30 | Context: The Environment

**[ACTION]** Scroll down smoothly to the "Context" section. Ensure the global map image is visible on the left, and the three cards are on the right. 

**Presenter:**
"Let's begin with Context—the external environment heavily dictates the trajectory of any education system."

**[ACTION]** Hover your mouse over the **Cultural** card.

**Presenter:**
"**Cultural:** Societal values and colonial histories deeply influence language preferences. In the Philippines, English is culturally viewed as the language of success and global competitiveness. In contrast, top-performing countries like Finland emphasize learning in a child's mother tongue from a young age."

**[ACTION]** Move your hover to the **Political** card.

**Presenter:**
"**Political:** Government policies dictate the medium of instruction. Top PISA performers often have decentralized policies allowing localization, whereas the Philippines utilizes a bilingual, heavily English-centric national curriculum."

**[ACTION]** Move your hover to the **Social** card.

**Presenter:**
"**Social:** Education is supposed to be the great equalizer. But when the language of instruction alienates the masses who don't speak English at home, it actually widens social stratification rather than closing it."

---

## 6:30 - 8:30 | Inputs: Resources Injected

**[ACTION]** Scroll down to the "Inputs" section. This section is reversed, with cards on the left.

**Presenter:**
"Moving to Inputs. The quality of educational delivery depends directly on the resources allocated to the system."

**[ACTION]** Hover over the **Material Resources** (Pink dot) card.

**Presenter:**
"**Material Resources:** There is a critical gap here. We lack textbooks and educational materials translated into local dialects, especially for complex subjects like Mathematics and Science."

**[ACTION]** Hover over the **Human Resources** (Blue dot) card.

**Presenter:**
"**Human Resources:** Our teachers are often put in a difficult position. They require specialized training to effectively translate complex English concepts into the mother tongue on the fly during classroom instruction."

**[ACTION]** Hover over the **Financial Resources** (Purple dot) card.

**Presenter:**
"**Financial Resources:** Ultimately, true localization efforts require significant government funding to ensure equitable access to quality education, funding which is often lacking."

## 8:30 - 12:00 | Processes: Delivery and Assessment

**[ACTION]** Scroll down to the dark "Processes" grid displaying the three icons. 

**Presenter:**
"How does this actually play out in the classroom? This brings us to Processes—how education is delivered."

**[ACTION]** Hover your mouse directly over the **Pedagogy** card to activate its bottom-right colored glow and spotlight effect.

**Presenter:**
"**Pedagogy:** Teaching methods change significantly when there's a language barrier. Educators often have to shift away from interactive, student-centered learning, resorting instead to lecture-based rote memorization simply to compensate for their students' vocabulary deficits."

**[ACTION]** Hover over the **Curriculum** card.

**Presenter:**
"**Curriculum:** The curriculum delivery must align with the linguistic realities of the students, but often it assumes a level of English proficiency that isn't present."

**[ACTION]** Hover over the **Assessment** card. Tap the desk or use slight hand gestures offline to emphasize this crucial point.

**Presenter:**
"**Assessment:** This is the crux of the issue. When a Filipino student takes the PISA exam, the test often measures their English reading comprehension simultaneously with their scientific or mathematical aptitude. This creates a massive, unfair **cognitive load** that students in top-performing, mother-tongue-tested nations simply do not face."

---

## 12:00 - 13:30 | The Cognitive Load: A Practical Example

**[ACTION]** Scroll down to the "VS" Comparison section. Hover your mouse over the blue "The Philippines" card on the left.

**Presenter:**
"Let's look at a practical example. Here is a sample 8th-grade science question. A Filipino student must first decode unfamiliar English vocabulary—like 'fluid' or 'molecular motion'. Then, they mentally translate that sentence structure into their native tongue, perhaps Tagalog or Cebuano. *Only then* can they access their scientific knowledge to actually solve the problem. As you can see, the cognitive load is immense."

**[ACTION]** Move your hover to the pink "Finland" card on the right. Point out the short cognitive load bar at the bottom.

**Presenter:**
"Now contrast this with a student in Finland, taking the exact same test, but in Finnish. They bypass the decoding and translation phases entirely. They immediately access their scientific knowledge to solve the problem. The cognitive load is minimal, allowing their true aptitude to shine through."

## 13:30 - 14:30 | Outcomes: The Results

**[ACTION]** Scroll to the "Outcomes" section with the accordion-style boxes. 

**Presenter:**
"So, what are the Outcomes of these mismatched contexts, inputs, and processes?"

**[ACTION]** Hover over the top **Student Achievement** box.

**Presenter:**
"**Student Achievement:** Unsurprisingly, academic performance and literacy levels in the Philippines show a direct, negative correlation with the foreign language used in standardized assessments."

**[ACTION]** Hover over the middle **Economic Outcomes** box.

**Presenter:**
"**Economic Outcomes:** The economic impact of education is hindered. When workforce development is compromised by these foundational learning gaps, the country's economic potential is capped."

**[ACTION]** Hover over the bottom **Social Outcomes** box.

**Presenter:**
"**Social Outcomes:** Ultimately, lower academic achievement limits global employment opportunities and civic engagement for a large portion of the population."

---

## 14:30 - 15:00 | The Data: 2022 PISA Scores

**[ACTION]** Look to the left side of the 'Outcomes' section where the new interactive PISA Chart is. Slowly hover your mouse over the bars to trigger the Chart.js tooltips.

**Presenter:**
"The data backs this up. If we look at the 2022 PISA average scores, the gap is stark. 

*(Hover over the pink/red bars)* The Philippines, taking the test in English, sits significantly below the OECD average. Notice that other countries where English is widespread as a second language but not the mother tongue—like Malaysia and Malta—also sit below the OECD average when taking the PISA in English.

*(Hover over the green and blue bars)* Meanwhile, look at the countries that test students in their mother tongue. Not just European nations like Finland and Estonia, but also Asian powerhouses like Japan and Macao. They consistently perform near or far above the OECD average. The linguistic barrier is not just a theory; it is quantifiable on a global scale."

---

## 15:00 - 15:30 | Conclusion & Wrap Up

**[ACTION]** Scroll to the very bottom "Conclusion" section. Let the large, colorful animated blob background draw the eye.

**Presenter:**
"To conclude our multidimensional comparison: it becomes glaringly evident that a student's capacity to learn and perform is intrinsically linked to the language of instruction and assessment. 

If we want to foster a truly global, equitable perspective on education, our policies must adapt. We must ensure that assessments act as a bridge to demonstrating knowledge, **not a linguistic barrier.**"

**[ACTION]** Slowly move your mouse to the "Back to Top" button to trigger the white shine animation. Click it, bringing the page smoothly back to the hero banner.

**Presenter:**
"Thank you very much for your time and attention. I would now like to open the floor to any questions."

### 💡 General Tips for the Presenter:
* **The Spotlight is your Laser Pointer:** You don't need a physical laser pointer. Because we added the mouse-tracking glow to the cards, simply hovering your mouse over the card you are currently reading actively draws the audience's eye directly to it.
* **Keep your mouse smooth:** Don't wiggle the mouse erratically. Move it deliberately from card to card in sync with your speech.
* **Master the timing:** The total presentation should take about 15 minutes. Spend the most time (around 3.5 minutes) on the "Processes" section, as the "Assessment/Cognitive Load" argument is the most important part of your thesis.
